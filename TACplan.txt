Here is my plan for the physics engine:

Car:
 - Position (x, y) <- cons cell
 - Velocity (vx, vy) <- cons cell
 - Velocity range:
   - 50 w/o boost
   - 100 w/ boost
 - Velocity decays @ 10 per second
 - Velocity goes to 0 upon colission with a wall

Ball:
 - Position x, y
 - Velocity vx, vy
 - Velocity decays @ 5 per second
 - Bounces:
   - Angle of incidence ...
   - Corners reverse direction
 - Speed control:
   - Car:
     - ball.vx = (+ ball.vx (/ car.vx 3))
     - ball.vy = (+ ball.vy (/ car.vy 3))
     - If either is larger than 100, reduce back to 100
   - Wall:
     - Velocity stays the same unless it hits a corner

Map Needs:
 - Position Definition:
   - (0,0) is the top-left corner of the screen
   - Positive x is right
   - Positive y is down
   - winSize = (WinX, WinY) size of window
 - Layout:
